# 🛠️ Milling Tool Wear Prognostics
**Deep Learning for Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing**

## 📌 Overview
An AI-driven approach to estimate tool wear in milling machines using multi-modal sensor data. This project bridges the gap between mechanical measurement systems and data science to prevent unplanned downtime.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
- `src/models`: Deep Temporal networks for time-series analysis.
- `src/pipeline`: Preprocessing logic for high-frequency sensor signals (Acoustic, Vibration, Current).
- `config/`: Hydra-managed configurations for sensor fusion experiments.

## 🔬 Physics-Engineering Context
As an engineer with 7 years in rolling stock, I focus on the **Signal Processing** aspect—ensuring the AI understands the physical vibration signatures of mechanical degradation.

## 📊 Dataset
Utilizing the **NASA Milling Dataset**, featuring experiments across various speeds, feeds, and depths of cut.
